I then moved on to more advanced topics such as Svelte/Sveltekit, Node.js, GSAP, and a little bit of three.js but I have begun to teach myself the backend of web development on my spare time with backend languages like <a href=\"https://go.dev\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Go</a> to become more of a fullstack developer."

I also enjoy creating animations for the web! I mainly enjoy animating the web because I believe that it makes the website look more professional and more appealing to the eye. In the world of web development, creating engaging and visually appealing animations is essential to grab the attention of users. I'm a natural problem-solver who thrives on turning complex problems into simple, beautiful solutions. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning."
