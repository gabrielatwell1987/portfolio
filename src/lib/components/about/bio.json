I then moved on to more advanced topics such as Svelte/Sveltekit, Node.js, GSAP, and a little bit of three.js but I have begun to teach myself the backend of web development on my spare time with backend languages like <a href=\"https://go.dev\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: 900;\">Go</a> to become more of a fullstack developer."

I also enjoy creating animations for the web! I mainly enjoy animating the web because I believe that it makes the website look more professional and more appealing to the eye. In the world of web development, creating engaging and visually appealing animations is essential to grab the attention of users. I'm a natural problem-solver who thrives on turning complex problems into simple, beautiful solutions. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning."

This makes your website able to be used on any device.. mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop. It's like having a mobile app that is not made with native technologies! There is also offline capabilities, so if your internet goes out, you can still access the site because your device downloads and caches the whole site!"
